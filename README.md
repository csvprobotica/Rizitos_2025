## 🔷 Introduction

We are **Team Rizitos**, a student robotics team from *Colegio San Vicente de Paúl* in Santiago, Veraguas 🇵🇦.  
Our group includes two seniors — **Flor Glaize** and **Francis Mojica** — and one junior, **Hebe Hernández**.

Together, we combine creativity, logic, and persistence to bring Rizitos to life: a fully autonomous robot designed to overcome obstacles, complete multiple laps, and finish strong.

Our goal isn’t just to build a robot — it’s to understand every part of it, and to represent Panama with purpose, precision, and pride.

## 🚗 And Here We Have **Rizitos**

</p>

**Rizitos** is an autonomous self-driving robot we designed and built from scratch for the WRO 2025 challenge.

The robot is based on a custom-modified chassis and multi-sensor platform. It includes ultrasonic detection, steering logic, lap tracking, and precise stop behavior — all coded in **Python**, running fully offline on a **Raspberry Pi 5**.

It navigates. It avoids. It completes 3 full laps. And it does it without any remote input.

## ⚙️ Autonomous Mobility System

Rizitos is designed to:

- Move forward autonomously  
- Detect lateral obstacles  
- Perform smooth steering  
- Complete 3 full laps  
- Stop at the starting position

### Core Logic:

1. **Obstacle Detection:**  
   The ultrasonic sensor continuously scans the front. If an obstacle is detected, the robot stops and begins a side scan using a rotating servo.

2. **Side Scanning & Decision Making:**  
   The scanning servo rotates the sensor left and right. Based on available space, the robot turns using the steering servo.

3. **Turning Mechanism:**  
   The steering servo (mounted on the front wheel axis) adjusts direction before the motors resume forward motion.

4. **Lap Counter:**  
   The robot internally counts laps using time or angle thresholds. After completing 3 full circuits, it stops all motors.

## 💡 Component Justification

- **DC Gear Motors:** Deliver enough torque and speed to maintain consistent movement across the test course.  
- **Motor Controller Board:** Provides safe GPIO interfacing with adequate current handling.  
- **MG90S Servos:** Lightweight and reliable for precise direction adjustments.  
- **Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04):** Balanced cost, simplicity, and sufficient accuracy for real-time navigation.  
- **Raspberry Pi 5:** Offers GPIO flexibility, multitasking capabilities, and support for Python-based logic.

## 🧭 Strategy for Performance

### Open Round (No Obstacles)

In the open round, Rizitos performs clean laps with the following logic:

- Motors activate forward motion (GPIO17 HIGH)  
- The ultrasonic sensor passively monitors distance (no evasive action)  
- The lap counter increments after each full loop  
- After completing 3 rotations, the robot stops and resets servo angles

### Obstacle Course Execution

In the challenge round with obstacles:

- If an obstacle is detected ≤ 15 cm ahead:  
  - Motors stop  
  - Scanning servo rotates the ultrasonic sensor (left to right)  
  - Robot decides the clearer path  
  - Steering servo turns left/right accordingly  
  - Motors resume forward motion

- Obstacle evasion repeats dynamically throughout the run
