##  Introduction

We are **Team Rizitos**, a student robotics team from *Colegio San Vicente de Pa√∫l* in Santiago, Veraguas üáµüá¶.  
Our group includes two seniors ‚Äî **Flor Glaize** and **Francis Mojica** ‚Äî and one junior, **Hebe Hern√°ndez**.

Together, we combine creativity, logic, and persistence to bring Rizitos to life: a fully autonomous robot designed to overcome obstacles, complete multiple laps, and finish strong.

</p>

**Rizitos** is our autonomous self-driving robot which is designed to complete 3 laps and overcome a variety of obstacles in the WRO Future Engineers Senior's course.

The robot is based on a custom-modified chassis and multi-sensor platform. It includes ultrasonic detection, steering logic, lap tracking, and precise stop behavior ‚Äî all coded in **Python**, running fully offline on a **Raspberry Pi 5**.

##  Engineering Materials

Below is a summary of the core components used to bring Rizitos to life. All parts were assembled and modified by us to meet the WRO Future Engineers 2025 challenge.

- Raspberry Pi 5 (central processor)
- Dual DC Motor Driver (GPIO-controlled)
- 2x MG90S Micro Servo Motors (steering + ultrasonic base)
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor
- 3D-printed camera + sensor mounts
- Modified smart car chassis with front-wheel steering
- USB Camera (used for testing only; not used during challenge)
- GPIO jumper wires, 9V battery case, L-type wrench, screwdrivers, and cable ties

##  Building Instructions

**Robot Structure:**
- The main concept for Rizitos' design was developed by our team using an external guide as reference.  
  ‚Üí [`M.V.P`](https://osoyoo.com/manual/sportcarkit.pdf)

**Operating Diagram:**
- The [`schemes/`](./schemes) folder contains all diagrams used to distribute Rizito's connection ports and lists all electronic components.

**Programming Code:**
- The [`src/`](./src) folder includes our Python source code that manages the robot‚Äôs movement, sensors, and decision-making logic.

> üõ†Ô∏è *All programming and hardware integration were completed by us from scratch.*

> [!NOTE]

> ‚öôÔ∏è **Rizitos is in constant evolution.**  
> As we iterate, test, and improve our system, both the software and hardware may be updated regularly.  
> If you notice inconsistencies between sections or media, feel free to reach out or contribute!

## Rizito's Mobility System

### Key Functional Behaviors

#### 1. **Continuous Forward Movement**
- The robot uses a **DC gear motor** connected through a **motor driver**.
- The motor is activated by `GPIO17` (forward) and deactivated by `GPIO27` (reverse stop).
- While moving forward, the ultrasonic sensor constantly checks the path ahead for potential obstacles.

#### 2. **Lateral Obstacle Detection & Evasion**
- An **ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)** mounted on a rotating servo scans the left and right sides.
- The scanning servo is controlled by `GPIO22`, and the sensor operates via `GPIO5` (Trig) and `GPIO6` (Echo).
- If an obstacle is detected within a 15 cm range:
  - Forward motion is halted.
  - The scanning servo rotates the sensor to both directions.
  - The robot chooses the clearer path.
  - It turns using the **steering servo** on `GPIO23`.
  - Then, forward motion resumes once the path is clear.

#### 3. **Turning and Steering**
- The robot uses a front-mounted **MG90S micro servo** on `GPIO23` for steering.
- It receives directional commands (left or right) based on sensor feedback.
- After completing the turn, the servo resets to its center position for straight movement.

#### 4. **Lap Completion and Stop Behavior**
- The robot keeps track of laps internally (via code).
- After completing **3 full laps**, it:
  - Deactivates the motor by setting `GPIO17` and `GPIO27` to LOW.
  - Centers the steering servo.
  - Stops at its starting position and remains idle.

| **DC Gear Motor**              | Drives the robot forward with consistent torque; controlled via motor driver.    |
| **Motor Driver Board**         | Interfaces motor control using GPIO signals for forward/reverse movement.        |
| **MG90S Servo (Steering)**     | Handles front-wheel steering with speed and precision.                          |
| **MG90S Servo (Sensor Mount)** | Rotates the ultrasonic sensor for side scanning.                                |
| **Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)**| Provides accurate distance measurements to detect obstacles.                     |
